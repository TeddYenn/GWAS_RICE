1.  **Identify the Genomic Region Associated With Seed Germination Under
    Aerobic Condition**

    -   Use the significant SNPs detected by FarmCPU or BLINK to
        pinpoint regions associated with seed germination. Also,
        consider the linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay rate in
        population to define the size of the candidate genomic region
        around each significant SNP.

    -   Examine local LD structure (e.g., haplotype blocks) to ensure
        the identified region is accurately confined to areas of strong
        linkage.

-   **Explore the Candidate Genomic Region:** Use external resources,
    databases, and literature to identify known genes, QTLs, or
    functional annotations within these regions.

-   **Clustering Analysis**

    -   Based on the allele calls (e.g., favorable vs. unfavorable) in
        the candidate region, cluster samples into groups or
        subpopulations.

    -   Compare germination rate across clusters to confirm whether
        certain haplotypes correlate with improved aerobic germination.

    -   Use PCA or other multivariate methods to visualize genetic
        relationships among the samples and confirm that the clustering
        aligns with the significant SNP variation.

-   **Identify Favorable Alleles:** Determine the effect size of each
    significant SNP or haplotype and whether it is associated with
    higher germination under aerobic conditions.
